# TODOs:


[] Build a tracker/server to maintain list of peers/nodes in the DHT
[] Build a p2p client using existing libraries for p2p like pyp2p
[] Integrate ML model code with p2p client
[] Centralized - client server federated learning approach
[] Identify and implement algorithms for weight update:
    a) Random peers
    b) Neighbors only
    c) Ring topology, etc

[] Compare centralized and p2p
    [] Identify metrics to compare besides ML parameters.
